 *
 * Distributed algorithms such as resource synchronization often depend on some
 * method of ordering events to function. For example, consider a system with
 * two processes and a disk. The processes send messages to each other, and also
 * send messages to the disk requesting access. The disk grants access in the
 * order the messages were sent. Now, imagine process 1 sends a message to the
 * disk asking for access to write, and then sends a message to process 2 asking
 * it to read. Process 2 receives the message, and as a result sends its own
 * message to the disk. Now, due to some timing delay, the disk receives both
 * messages at the same time.
 *
 * Leslie Lamport provided a elegant solution to the above problem. It follows
 * some simple rules : 1) A process increments its counter before each event in
 * that process; 2) When a process sends a message, it includes its counter
 * value with the message; 3) On receiving a message, the receiver process set
 * its counter to be greater than the maximum of its own value and the received
 * value before it
